# Project Name
> Melanoma Detection Assignment


<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- Just to summarise the entire process that was carried out, Set out the initial structure with the right optimisers and loss function so that, we dont have to tweak that whenever we made a big change After the first iteration, we observed that the model was overfitting, hence needed data augmentation In the second itertion, when simple data augmentation was applied, overfitting reduced with reduction in accuracy On further investigation realised that the dataset is class imbalanced, with the help of the Augmentor library added 500 images to each class to make it a balanced class distribution, upon doing this, the model still did not overfit but accuracies went up, with more tweaking of hyperparameters we are confident we will be resulting in a better model, but due to interest of time and submission deadlines, finalizing the exercise with the above learnings
